## Project Description

This project demonstrates various design patterns in C++ through a series of examples and exercises. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of design patterns and their applications in software development.

## Gyms

1. **Gym01**: Demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) in a card game.
2. **Gym02**: Implements the Strategy pattern for a matchmaking system.
3. **Gym03**: Showcases the use of the Template Method pattern in a card game.
4. **Gym04**: Demonstrates the use of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in a collision handling system.
5. **Gym05**: Integrates the concepts from Gym01 to Gym04.
6. **Gym06**: Showcases the Observer pattern in a YouTube-like subscription system.
7. **Gym07**: Demonstrates the use of the Command pattern in a keyboard control system.
8. **Gym08**: Implements the State pattern in an adventure game.
9. **Gym09**: Integrates the concepts from Gym05 to Gym08.
10. **Gym10**: Demonstrates the use of the Facade pattern in a prescription system.
11. **Gym11**: Implements the Adapter pattern in a relationship analyzer.
12. **Gym12**: Showcases the use of the Proxy pattern in a database system.
13. **Gym13**: Demonstrates the use of the Composite pattern in a logger system.
14. **Gym14**: Implements the Decorator pattern in an HTTP client.
